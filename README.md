# MongoDB_demo
My own MongoDB Demo Scripts. This might grow over time. The following scripts are currently available:

# 1. downloadBackupFullAuto.sh
A fully automized download script that triggers the download of a cloud back (snapshot) in MongoDB Atlas. After the preparation phase, a constant scanning for the download URL occurs. Once the URL is available, it is echoed into the shell. 
Requires JQ.
